# Python
Additionally, during my six-month internship at Huawei, I extensively used Python, gaining substantial hands-on experience.
And I created the Sihangchat robot backend server in Python, which using Langchain to combine with huggingface model and chatgpt LLM API in Python.
# C/C++
I started taking C/C++ courses and lab during my bachelor studies, building a solid foundation in these languages. In my recent Smart Card lab project(2024.10.01-2025.02.06) at university, I was responsible for implementing the AES decryption algorithm in C. 
# Soldering
In my last student job, I became familiar with soldering (using a soldering iron), screwdriver kits, multimeters, oscilloscopes, and other related tools. This hands-on experience makes me confident in tackling hardware-related tasks.
# MATLAB
I did a praxis project using MATLAB to simulate multipath propagation and fast fading of mobile radio channels using MATLAB.  
but now I just remember some basic knowledge about MATLAB. 
# VHDL
I did a VHDL lab at TUM university(2024.04-2024.07), In this project/lab, I used VHDL to implement and simulate the International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) by software Xilinx ISE independently. Then I tested the implementations on an FPGA board(Spartan-3E Starter Kit). In the end, I did two optimizations, the first optimization uses the control unit and registers to achieve only one round for eight times encryption process. For the second time, The use of FPGA resources is further reduced by slitting a round into 4 partial steps and reusing Adder, multipliers and XOR Modules.
# SQlite
during my six-month internship at Huawei, I learn how to use the SQlite3 library in Python to record download information, So that know some basic opration for .db file/table, for example SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE,  INSERT.
