# sihang's Projects：

## Condition Monitoring of Vehicles  
**Duration**: 15/05/2023 – 01/08/2023  
Content: In the Bachelor’s thesis, I integrated the STMicroelectronics ASM330LHHX sensor (featuring a gyroscope, accelerometer, and on-board Machine Learning Core) with the Texas Instruments INA228 current/voltage sensor via I²C. The system applies a decision tree algorithm for real-time vehicle motion detection and measures overall power consumption, providing insights for subsequent energy optimization.
